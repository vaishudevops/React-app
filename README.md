Props : props are the objects that contains the atributes and threei values passed from the praent components..
if we want disply the value passed to the component we use (props.value).
To specify props to the component we specify them as the Atributes.. in App.js file at Component Place ex: <Sample / name = "props demo..">
<Sample /  name ="Bruce"> // should be written in the app.js ie parent component.
in the Sample component we should write the refer book where i have written  the component code for sample..
